 * Problem
 * In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.
 * The reverse complement of a DNA string ss is the string scsc formed by reversing the symbols of ss, then taking
 * the complement of each symbol (e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC").
 * Given: A DNA string ss of length at most 1000 bp.
 * Return: The reverse complement scsc of ss.
